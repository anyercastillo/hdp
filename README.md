# POC 
The main goal of this project is to interface with **Bluetooth Heart Rate Service.** 
Check the project https://github.com/anyercastillo/gatt-server for a mock device

# Watch for:
- Bluetooth Gatt https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothGatt 
- Navigation https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/
- RecyclerView with ListAdapter for a better performance
- Material Design
- Room
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Coroutines
- DataBinding
- LifeCycle Aware
- Factory Pattern

# Things learnt
- BluetoothHealth was deprecated in API level 29. 
New apps should use Bluetooth Low Energy based solutions such as BluetoothGatt.

# BLE Peripheral Simulators

Android App https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.webbluetoothcg.bletestperipheral&hl=en_US
Rest API https://github.com/anyercastillo/gatt-server

# BLE specs

## How to test it.
1. Enable Bluetooth.
2. Launch the app.
3. Scan for new devices broadcasting heart rate.
4. Each device listed will auto-refresh if the data change.
5. Trigger a "heart rate" from the BLE device or change the "body sensor location" value.
